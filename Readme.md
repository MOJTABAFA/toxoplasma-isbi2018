***This Repository is created to share the codes for ISBI 2018 paper with title of _UNSUPERVISED DISCOVERY OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII MOTILITY PHENOTYPES_***

We implemented our pipeline using Python 3 and associated scientific computing libraries ***(NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn,
matplotlib)*** .The core of our tracking algorithm used a combination of tools available in the OpenCV 3.1 computer vision library
